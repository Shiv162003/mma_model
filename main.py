Tweets without hate speech (blue bars) tend to be slightly longer on average compared to tweets with hate speech (orange bars).
Both types of tweets peak around the 30-60 character range, but hate speech tweets have a broader range in length.
This suggests that hate speech tweets might be more variable in length, with a higher count at shorter lengths and a lower presence in longer lengths compared to non-hate speech tweets.
