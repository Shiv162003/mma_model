# Multimodal Hate Speech Detection

## Overview

The **Multimodal Hate Speech Detector** is a machine learning application that uses both text and audio data to detect hate speech in online communication. By leveraging **text processing** and **audio processing** (specifically **melspectrograms**), the system is able to classify speech as hate speech or non-hate speech based on the content and tone of the communication.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of text and audio modalities to offer an improved and nuanced approach to detecting harmful content online. The system is implemented using **Streamlit** for the frontend and uses **librosa** for audio processing and **NLP** techniques for text analysis.

## Features

- **Text Modality**: Analyzes text to detect hate speech through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques.
- **Audio Modality**: Processes audio data by generating melspectrograms to capture tonal features associated with hate speech.
- **Fusion**: Combines the results from both modalities to provide more accurate hate speech detection.

## How It Works

### 1. **Text Analysis**
   - The system processes text data (e.g., tweets, comments) to detect harmful language and context.
   - NLP techniques and sentiment analysis are applied to identify negativity or harmful content in the text.

### 2. **Audio Processing**
   - Audio data is processed using **librosa** to generate **melspectrograms**, which capture tonal features like pitch, volume, and cadenceâ€”important for detecting spoken hate speech.
   
### 3. **Fusion Approach**
   - The results from both text and audio analysis are combined using **fusion techniques** (Early Fusion, Late Fusion, and Hybrid Fusion).
   - This approach provides a more holistic understanding of the content, improving detection accuracy across platforms.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- Streamlit
- librosa
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- pandas
- sklearn
- wordcloud
- streamlit-option-menu

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the web application in your browser.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations are generated to provide insights into the dataset and the results of the hate speech detection:

1. **Tweet Length Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of tweet lengths, categorized by whether they contain hate speech.
2. **Word Cloud**: A word cloud for hate speech tweets that visualizes the most frequent offensive terms.
3. **Melspectrograms**: Mel spectrogram plots generated for audio data to analyze the tonal features of speech.
